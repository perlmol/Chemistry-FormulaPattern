Chemistry::FormulaPattern version 0.10
======================================

This module implements a simple language for describing a range of
molecular formulas and allows one to find out whether a molecule matches
the formula specification. It can be used for searching for molecules by
formula, in a way similar to the NIST WebBook formula search
(L<http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/form-ser.html>). Note however that the
language used by this module is different from the one used by the WebBook!
